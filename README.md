# webscraping_challenge
The code for both parts automates web scraping and data analysis. In Part 1, Splinter is used to visit the Mars News website, BeautifulSoup scrapes titles and previews, and the data is stored in a list of dictionaries. In Part 2, the code visits the Mars Temperature Data site, scrapes a table, processes it into a Pandas DataFrame, converts data types, and performs analysis like calculating monthly averages and visualizing temperature and pressure trends. The results are then saved as a CSV file. for a couple of seconds. Both parts use Splinter for browser automation and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML. In Part 1, the code extracts Mars news titles and previews into dictionaries, while Part 2 scrapes Mars weather data from an HTML table, converts it into a Pandas DataFrame, cleans and analyzes the data with visualizations, and saves the results as a CSV file. Data analysis included in Part 2 file. All code written by myself with help troubleshooting from ChatGPT.
